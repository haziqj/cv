# CV -- Haziq Jamil

This repo contains the source files for the HTML and PDF versions of my CV. Thanks to the following people / projects for creating the tools and the inspiration to make this possible!

- [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) -- to paginate the HTML output of R Markdown
- [Ulrik Lyng's CV](https://ulyngs.github.io/pagedown-cv/) -- an aesthetically-pleasing one-column CV layout
- [Nick Strayer's CV](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv) -- inspiration for [data driven CV](https://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv)

I've set GitHub Actions to build my CV daily (maybe an overkill, we'll see). I can just update the Google Sheets and in theory the CV website and PDF will be built automatically with the updated data. Cool.
